**📝 Student Marks Analyzer**
**📌 Project Overview**
The Student Marks Analyzer project demonstrates how to use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib together to:

Load and clean a dataset of student marks.

Perform analysis using Pandas & NumPy (averages, totals, highest marks).

Visualize student performance using bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.

Export the cleaned and analyzed dataset for reporting.

This project is ideal for practicing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

**📂 Dataset Information**

**Columns:**

Name → Student name

Math → Marks in Math

Physics → Marks in Physics

Chemistry → Marks in Chemistry

Total → Total marks of each student (calculated)

Average → Average marks of each student (calculated)

Rows: Each row represents one student’s record.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python 3

NumPy for mathematical calculations

Pandas for data handling and cleaning

Matplotlib for visualizations

**📑 Analysis Performed**

✔️ Filled missing values with subject averages
✔️ Calculated Total and Average marks per student
✔️ Identified highest marks in each subject
✔️ Calculated class averages with NumPy
✔️ Exported cleaned dataset to student_report.csv

**📊 Visualizations**

The project includes multiple plots for better insights:

📊 Bar Chart → Total marks per student

📉 Histogram → Distribution of Math scores

🥧 Pie Chart → Percentage contribution of each student’s total marks

**📂 Files in Repository**
